# Sea Battle Game

## Project Description

Sea battle game allows 2 players to play Sea battle game on the same computer with 2 displays with one mouse cursor. It doesn't have to be necessarily 2 displays. It's convenient to play when displays are opposite to each other.

In this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript because they are the technologies which I know and decided to consolidate my knowledge and acquire some new project building skills while building this project. I also used module bundler parcel which made it easier to develop this project.

While building this project there were times when I faced a problem of not being able to implement certain things, but, I just tried again and again and I implemented a lot of them just by pushing and pushing forward untill I completed what I planned to complete. When I just pushed forward when things didn't go well I was getting better and better at understanding of things I tried to implement.

## How to Install and Run the Project

Then open the project in VS Code, open terminal and run command "npm install" which will install all dependencies for this project and after all of that run the project on a local machine.

## Attribution for media used in the project

In this project I used icons from https://icons8.com, also from https://ionic.io/ionicons and "Icon made by Freepik from https://www.flaticon.com/".

## How to Use the Project

I included game rules right on the page itself, so you will be able to read them there.

That's all for now, have a great time!
