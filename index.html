          In Sea Battle game you play against an opponent, both of you have two
          10x10 grids, one grid is for your own ships, and another one is for
          your opponent's ships which you are trying to discover. You start by
          arranging your ships on your grid. You have these kinds of ships:

        <p>
          The ships cannot be next to each other on the grid, not even
          diagonally, they must always be at least one square away from one
          another. Also every ship except destroyer consists of multiple parts
          which you cannot mix together with parts of different ships and to see
          the difference between them every part has corresponding size label.
          You can arrange them as you want by dragging and dropping them
          following ship placement rules.

        <p>
          After the game started players take turns clicking(shooting) on the
          grid. If you miss the turn changes and if you hit a ship you get to
          shoot again. You mark which squares are hits and which are misses and
          try to be the first to sink all your opponent's ships. The first
          player to sink their opponent's ships or the first player whose enemy
          loses all his time wins the game.
