# Sea Battle Game

1. User stories

1) As a player I want to be able to build my fleet on the sea grid, so I can set up everything to start playing the game
2) As a player I want to have one part of the sea with my own ships and the second part with my enemy's ships, so I can shoot in them and they will be partly or completely destroyed
3) My enemy also should have the similar setup as I have in the beginning, so we can both start playing
4) My enemy's ships should be hidden and only if I damaged his ship or completely destroyed it, so only then his damaged part of the ship or a completely destroyed ship should be visible because I found it myself
5) The player who destroyed all enemy's ships will win in the game and it will be finished
